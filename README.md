## About This Page

This is the personal Github page for **Michael Letheby**. Below you'll find links to a number of personal data analysis related projects I've worked on. I'll mainly be taking on projects that I find personally interesting or that can teach me new skills (hopefully both in most cases).

This page is only intended as a centralised source for my personal projects so don't expect to see any musings or personal thoughts. Even so as a general disclaimer any work or commentary within this webpage is my personal opinion and does not reflect that of my employers.

## About Me

I'm a finance-professional based in Sydney, Australia with an interest in data analysis and predictive modelling. I started this page in order to share projects I've been working on in order to capture my own learnings and help data professionals (both present and future).

I have experience using a number of tools and languages including:

* **R**
* **SAS**
* **Excel (VBA)**
* **Tableau**
* **Alteryx**

At the time of writing my workflow of choice is **R** (data analysis and modelling), **R Markdown** (data presentation), **Atom** (maintaining this Github page) and **Github** (version control repository). My next goal is integrating Python into my skillset.

## Projects

Below you'll find a list of personal projects I've worked on:

* [Who will Survive the Titanic?](/docs/Titanic_Machine_Learning_v3.html): A classic Kaggle problem where I aim to predict which passengers on the fateful voyage of the Titanic would survive. This is a **supervised classification problem** and a great starting point for developing **predictive models**.
* [US Baby Names 1880-2018](/docs/Titanic_Machine_Learning_v3.html): An **exploratory data analysis** of baby names registered in the United States of America between 1880-2018. I found this dataset online myself with an aim to investigate how name trends change over time.

Each of the project pages contain links to the GitHub repos that house the raw code and data used to perform the analysis. I may periodically return to past projects as I learn new skills in order to polish them further.

## Learners

If you are new to data analysis/ science I highly recommend the below resources which all helped me immeasurably.

* **[Learn to code in R]**(https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html): A comprehensive source to R with a focus on  data analysis and modelling that is perfect for those unfamiliar with the language.
* **[Applied predictive modelling]**(http://appliedpredictivemodeling.com/): A great resource on the theory and application of predictive modelling. It is based on the caret package in R but its principles should be useful to all professionals.
* **[Using R Markdown]**(https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/): An essential tool for R users who plan to ever present their work (or handover work to teammates). No more tedious back-and-forth between your analysis and your presentation.
* **[Data problems to apply skills on]**(https://www.kaggle.com/): Contains a large number of datasets and (more importantly) discussions on solving various data science problems.
